## Logic-Circle

A problem was presented in our Discrete Math class that stated there exists a circle with 9 numbers around it. 5 of the numbers are 0's and 4 of them are 1's. Someone then goes around and takes two numbers at a time and determines a number to be placed inbetween. They do this for the whole circle adding 9 more numbers, then finally removing the originals. The determination of the next set of numbers are as follows: <br><br>

If the two numbers are 0's then the new number is also 0. If both numbers are 1's then the new number is 0. Should they not be the same number, say 1 and 0 or 0 and 1, then the resulting number would be 1. <br><br>

We were then asked to determine if the circle would ever become a circle of all zeros given a certain arrangement. With a quick proof you can show there will always exist one 1 and therefore will never have a circle entirely of 0's. <br><br>

Given this program would cause an infinite loop we had to make it, especially during class. We had 4 mins to finish it by the end of class to little avail. See the first commit for our meager 4-minute coding results. <br><br>
